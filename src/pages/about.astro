            <p>
              What started as a personal goal for 2025 quickly evolved into
              something I believe could be transformative for others too.
              Whether you're just starting out or you're a seasoned veteran,
              there's a place for you in this journey.
            </p>
            <p>
              Together, we'll push boundaries, create freely, and grow both
              personally and professionally. This isn't just about building
              productsâ€”it's about building ourselves.

                    Ship every month to overcome fear of failure
                  </h4>
                  <p>
                    Like many of you, I've been in tech for a while, yet I still
                    feel like a beginner sometimes. I have countless projects
                    that never saw the light of day. Shipping is better than
                    perfect! This program is designed to help us collectively
                    overcome the fear of failure.

                    Ship every month to increase probability of success
                  </h4>
                  <p>
                    We often hear "idea is cheap, execution is key." Shipping
                    monthly increases our chances of success by letting the
                    market, not our doubts, decide what works. The only way to
                    learn is to launch.

                    Shipping every month sounds fun!
                  </h4>
                  <p>
                    Creating is fun! Seeing your creation used by others is even
                    better. Unlike my full-time job where we systematically plan
                    product launches, this is our playground for freedom and
                    creativity.

                    This forces us to create real value. I know most of us shy
                    away from making something people pay but I want you to when
                    you can explore this as soonest.
