  {
    question: "Do I need to follow everything here?",
    answer:
      "We follow the 12 in 12 challenge for a good reason, but feel free to adjust it to your own pace. Prioritize your health and wellbeing as this is not a race, and taking time off when needed is perfectly okay or you tend to your priorities first is perfectly understandable.",
  },
  {
    question: "What tools do I use?",
    answer:
      "You are free to use any tools, including AI and LLMs like ChatGPT for anything including the code, idea, or marketing!",
  },
  {
    question: "Should I be spending money now?",
    answer:
      "This is up to your discretion but for bootstrapping a project, we would minimize our cost and keep everything as close to $0 especially when starting out.",
  },
  {
    question: "I have zero knowledge on how to get started?",
    answer:
      "That's perfectly fine! We provide step-by-step guides and a supportive community to help you learn and grow.",
  },
  {
    question: `Isn't a month too short to build and ship?`,
    answer:
      "Not necessarily! Keeping the timeline short aligns with Parkinson's Law: work expands or contracts based on the time given. A hard one-month deadline fosters urgency and focus, encouraging prioritization, reduced distractions, and greater efficiency.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if I fail to finish in a month?",
    answer:
      "That’s totally okay! The goal of the program is progress, not perfection. Even if you don’t finish in a month, the momentum you’ve built is a win. You can carry over unfinished goals to the next month or adjust your pace.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need coding or technical skills to participate?",
    answer:
      "Not at all! While some projects may involve technical skills, many can be creative, service-oriented, or personal development-focused. The community and resources are here to guide you no matter your starting point.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I work on more than one project at a time?",
    answer:
      "It’s recommended to focus on one project per month to ensure deep focus and high-quality results. However, if you feel confident juggling multiple goals, you’re welcome to do so!",
  },
  {
    question: "What kind of projects can I work on?",
    answer:
      "Anything you’re passionate about! This could range from launching a small business, writing a book, developing a personal habit, or learning a new skill. The possibilities are endless, and the program is flexible enough to accommodate any goal.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I stay motivated throughout the month?",
    answer:
      "We encourage regular check-ins, accountability groups, and celebrating small wins. The community is here to support you when things get tough, so don’t hesitate to reach out.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I know if my project idea is good enough?",
    answer:
      "Don’t worry about perfection! The challenge is about taking action and learning along the way. Even if your idea evolves, the experience you gain is invaluable.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to share my progress publicly?",
    answer:
      "Sharing progress is encouraged but not required. Many find public accountability helpful, but you’re free to keep your journey private if you prefer.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I join anytime, or are there specific start dates?",
    answer:
      "You can join at any time! While many participants align their projects with the calendar month, the challenge is flexible and can start whenever you’re ready.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I join the community?",
    answer:
      "Joining the community is easy — just head to our Discord server or check out our onboarding guide to get started. You’ll find plenty of resources and friendly faces to welcome you.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens after 12 months?",
    answer:
      "That’s entirely up to you! Some participants repeat the challenge with new goals, while others use what they’ve learned to pursue larger projects. The experience is designed to set you up for long-term growth.",
  },
