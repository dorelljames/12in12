# 12 Products (or startups) in 12 Months

\*Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use.‚Äù - **Steve Jobs\***

Hello everyone, [**Dorell**](https://dorelljames.com) here! üëã

I‚Äôve been thinking a lot of what I wanted to do this year 2025 and what started as a personal goal of mine quickly grew to something that I think could potentially be also helpful to others. So whether you‚Äôre a beginner, pro and/or veteran, I believe there is a place for you here.

_Join me on a journey to build 12 products (or startups) in 12 months. Together, we‚Äôll push boundaries, create freely, and grow both personally and professionally._

## What is this all about?

The **12 products (or startups) in 12 months program** is inspired from https://levels.io/12-startups-12-months/. At least, here, the goal is to NOT only make progress, commit to things but to finish and launch whatever you started. Peter Levels shares the common challenges we often face especially in this modern age of limited focus and full of distractions. First is ‚Äú**finishing**‚Äù _(I‚Äôm guilty)_ and second ‚Äú**launching**‚Äù _(guilty as well üòÖ)._ He says that this kills good ideas and so this is a matter of really taking things in our own hands, thus the program or for some a challenge.

## Now, the why?

I believe it‚Äôs important to understand our reasons why we would like to embark on this journey. After all, this is for most people a very huge uptake! Yes, this is an extremely demanding and challenging task year throughout and depending on one‚Äôs situation, this might feel impossible.

Ok, now, the first thing that really comes to your mind is the thought that says ‚Äú**this isn‚Äôt for me!**‚Äù. If you feel or think that way, let me tell you how that‚Äôs a good thing. Why? It just means that you can learn a lot from this and what you really feel right now deep inside you is that fear that tells you that you‚Äôre not there yet at that level.

Oh yeah, this is for PROs, right? The straight answer to that is NO.

The program/challenge aims to bring out the best in you, to commit to the things you‚Äôve been putting on hold, to gain that confidence that even though I don‚Äôt have everything figured out, I know to myself that I am capable of doing something. And more importantly, that you‚Äôre NOT alone in this journey - wherever you are in life.

As a beginner, you can use this opportunity to up skill and use the products you ship as your portfolio.

As for advance, perhaps you‚Äôve been itching to scratch that itch and/or ship that profitable product idea you‚Äôve always wanted.

For others, this might also be a fun thing to be part of relating to others, social, offer advice, etc.

    ***I will become a tiny, hyperfast product lab.***

    **Reason #1: Ship every month helps to overcome fear of failure**
    
    If you‚Äôre like me, I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm 100% confident in this practice. I have been in the tech industry for quite a while yet I feel like I‚Äôm still a beginner. Also, I got a lot of projects that never saw the light at the end of the tunnel. Guilty? üòÖ Shipping is better than perfect! Failing is part of it. These are the things that I want to learn to embrace within me. This program is designed to help us collectively overcome the fear of failure!
    
    **Reason #2: Ship every month to increase the probability of success**
    
    Are you still thinking about the best idea to make? Doing all due diligence whether this idea is feasible or not. Stuck? 
    
    I hear this every time from my friends and everyone in my circle, ***‚Äúidea is cheap, execution is the key‚Äù***. Shipping every month increases the chances of success in a way that I tell myself that it is not my job to tell me that this idea and/or product won‚Äôt work, only the market. Also, if I don‚Äôt put something out there, I don‚Äôt know what the world wants. So, for me, the only way to learn is to launch. Will launching multiple increase the chance of our success? Idk but it allows me to learn as fast as I can and get to the nitty gritty of things.
    
    **Reason #3: Shipping every month sounds fun**
    
    Creating is fun! Seeing your creation used by others is way more fun. This is me coming from my experience creating [Cebby](https://getcebby.com). Unlike in my full job where we to have systematically plan and strategize when launching products, this is something we can have all the freedom to choose what we do and prioritize.

## Now, let me ask you. What do you think?

### **_If this is something that got you interested, read on‚Ä¶_**

Now, that we got our reasons set in, l**et‚Äôs tackle the HOW‚Ä¶**

You‚Äôll say, Dorell, I don‚Äôt know where to start. What should I do?

## Ok, let‚Äôs get it on‚Ä¶

This workspace‚Äôs objective is NOT only to guide you and have a formal structure starting from possibly zero to become a hero. All I ask really is we work closely to help each other improve this not just for ourselves but also to all of those who are embarking on the same journey as we are.

By the way, I set myself some rules to further guide and help me be laser focused on the things that I should be doing. üòä

This is completely optional but for me this is important as it guides me to adhere to this to keep what I‚Äôm doing laser focused. If you like the idea of doing the same, you can follow my rules and/or change this to whatever you feel like you should be doing.

### Rules for the program

My rules for the program challenge are simple:

1. **Launch a product each month**

   No excuses! Build and launch.

1. **Product has to be paid. No freebies.**

   This forces me to get something out there with real value and has potential to change my life! Personal reason but yeah, I kinda want to succeed in this area.

1. **Launching includes (lots of) marketing.**

### Common Questions

---

- **Do I need to follow everything here?**
  Take it at your own pace, if you need to take time off, please do, this is not a race, if you need to pace yourself or if something comes up including burnout and mental health, let this go to the back burner (your health is more important ‚ú®)
- **Why do I only need to do 1 product (or startup) per month?**
  Stick strictly to 1 product (or startup) per month, this means you get 30 or 31 consecutive days to work on this 1 idea. Do not start anything beforehand. Stop working on it after the time is up unless there is potential in the idea. Again, completion is better than perfect.
- **What tools do I use? Are there any limitations?**
  You are free to use any tools, including AI and LLMs like ChatGPT for anything including the code, idea, or marketing! ü§ñ
  _If you‚Äôre looking to know what I use, go here._
- **I have zero knowledge on how to get started?**
  Me too üòÖ¬†but let‚Äôs see, after spending a good amount of time with this, I hope this guide ‚Üí ([Step by step guide from to shipping a product](https://www.notion.so/Step-by-step-guide-from-to-shipping-a-product-16e3f8eda0708091ac8cd4863bb5831d?pvs=21)) can help you get started. Please ask any questions there and/or leave any feedback so we can further improve it.
- **Should I be spending $$$ now?**
  This is up to your discretion but for bootstrapping a project, we would to minimize our cost. I have prepared this document which outlines the potential tools we can make use of and keep everything as close as to $0 especially when we‚Äôre starting out.
- **I‚Äôm interested in joining the program but I don‚Äôt think I can commit to 12 months. What should I do?**
  You can also play around with this concept and do 6 products in 6 months or 6 products in 12 months but 12 over 12 is recommended at least to start off since we want to iterate fast and break things. Whatever feels right for you!

### Tips

---

- Ideally start looking for product market fit before building MVP
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Feel free to pivot at any time, if you can see that the pivot goes in a completely new direction, you can always save the idea for next month ü§î
- You can totally do this challenge while holding a full time job, just plan your time out well and execute when you have spare time
- ‚úÖ If you feel like your startup has legs to stand on after the month, break from the challenge and pursue it! This is the ideal state!

OK, for now, if you like to join the DISCORD server we‚Äôre preparing, you can [do so via this link](https://discord.gg/mKefA6t3ha).

NOTE: There‚Äôs no onboarding experience yet and no clear direction yet on how you‚Äôll benefit from having this server. Personally, I‚Äôll be there to do daily check ins keeping myself accountable.

_Beyond this point is a draft but I‚Äôm planning to share the resources I have gathered for the past few months and find a structure that we could all follow._

PS: I‚Äôm working on a platform where we can collectively create our own profile journeys and for each month, we can showcase what we‚Äôre working on.
